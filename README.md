## Overview

**RPN Fine-Tuning for People Detection** demonstrates how to refine a Region Proposal Network to accurately identify people using the Penn-Fudan Pedestrian Detection dataset. This project is presented as an interactive Jupyter Notebook that guides you step-by-step through data preparation, model training, evaluation, and even live video inference.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Notebook:** Everything you need is in one place—from dataset handling to live detection.
- **Real-Time Video Analysis:** Utilize OpenCV to process and annotate video frames on the fly.
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily swap model backbones (ResNet, MobileNetV2, etc.) or customize data transformations.
- **Scalable & Adaptable:** Perfect for learning object detection fundamentals and extending to multi-class problems.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/BrunooCS/RPN-Fine-Tuning-for-People-Detection.git
   ```
2. **Open the Notebook:**
   Launch Jupyter Notebook (or your preferred environment) and open `Object Detection Finetuning.ipynb`.
3. **Run & Explore:**
   Execute the cells sequentially to see the RPN in action—detecting pedestrians in images and videos.

> **Tip:** Each cell contains detailed explanations to help you grasp both the theory and practice behind the model.
